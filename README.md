# EDA-Data-Visulaization-AtliQ-Hospitality-Analysis

Problem Statement:
Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue.
However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights. Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

# Overall Summary and Important Insights:

Atliq Grands, a luxury hotel chain, is facing declining market share and revenue due to competition and poor decision-making. Here are the key factors identified:

1. **Room Capacity and Demand Mismatch:** The hotels have many large rooms (30 guests) but most bookings are for smaller ones (10-15 guests). This mismatch wastes resources and hurts revenue.
2. **Revenue Concentration in Lower-Priced Segments:** The chain makes more money from lower-priced bookings, suggesting a need to target higher-paying customers. 
3. **Seasonal Fluctuations and Recent Revenue Decline:** Revenue fluctuates with seasons, but there's also a concerning recent drop that needs attention.
4. **Property Performance Disparities:** Some hotels, like Attiq Palace, do much better than others, like Attiq Seasons. Underperforming properties drag down the whole chain.
5. **Untapped Market Segments:** While most bookings are for luxury hotels, there are also significant business class bookings. This suggests an untapped market opportunity.
6. **Customer Segmentation Opportunities:** Customer analysis reveals three distinct groups based on spending and ratings. Tailoring strategies for each group can improve experience and pricing, especially for the moderate spenders.

# Key Metrics and Factors Influencing Market Share and Revenue Loss:

1. **Room Capacity and Demand Mismatch:** This mismatch leads to inefficient resource allocation and decreased revenue and market share.
2. **Revenue Concentration in Lower-Priced Segments:** Focusing on lower-priced bookings hurts profitability and competitiveness in luxury/business hotels.
3. **Recent Revenue Decline:** The recent revenue drop is a major concern and could indicate significant market share loss.
4. **Property Performance Disparities:** Underperforming properties bring down the entire chain's market share and revenue.
5. **Untapped Market Segments:** Ignoring potential markets like business hotels means missing growth and revenue opportunities.
6. **Customer Experience and Satisfaction:**  The customer segmentation suggests that improving experience, especially for moderate spenders, can help regain market share and revenue. 

# Strategies to Regain Market Share and Revenue:

Here are some strategies Atliq Grands can use to address these challenges and succeed:

1. **Room Capacity Optimization:** Analyze room capacity and demand to better match room types and sizes with customer preferences, leading to more efficient resource allocation and revenue generation.
2. **Pricing Strategy Optimization:** Review pricing strategies and adjust them to target higher-revenue segments more effectively, while still offering a mix of room categories for diverse customer needs.
3. **Peak Season Capitalization:** Use data to identify peak seasons and tailor marketing campaigns, promotions, and operations to maximize bookings and revenue during those periods.
4. **Targeted Marketing and Property Improvements:** Implement targeted marketing efforts and improve operations for underperforming properties like Attiq Seasons to boost their bookings and revenue contribution.
5. **Expansion into Untapped Market Segments:** Explore opportunities in untapped markets like business hotels by adapting offerings, pricing, and marketing to these potential customers.
6. **Customer Experience Enhancement:** Prioritize enhancing customer experience, especially for the moderate-revenue segment, by improving service, upgrading amenities, and offering personalized options. This will improve customer satisfaction, ratings, and ultimately, market share and revenue.  
7. **Market and Competitor Analysis:** Conduct in-depth market and competitor analysis to identify emerging trends, customer preferences, and competitor strategies. This will enable proactive decision-making and differentiation in the luxury/business hotel category.

By implementing these data-driven strategies, Atliq Grands can address the challenges they face, capitalize on new opportunities, and regain their market share and revenue in the competitive luxury/business hotel market.
